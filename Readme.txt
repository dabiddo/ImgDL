Image DownLoader

Is a nifty application created in C#

What it does?
It examines a url and extract the code, it examines the html and looks for links
that have an image and downloads it

Initial Development.
As of today, the image only scans for the URLS but does not download the images yet.

Comments have been added to the application, and is it usable now, it can download images, im still working on some bugs,
and im trying to figure out how to make the damn picturebox load the image.
